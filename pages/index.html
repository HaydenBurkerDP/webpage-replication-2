            <a href="https://www.mikepatey.com/">Mike Patey</a> was born in
            Gresham, Oregon, along with twin brother, Mark, right in the middle
            of 11 children. He and his wife, Chandra, who is a pilot as well,
            have 4 children. His aviation journey began in a 1971 Cessna 172L in
            2002. He subsequently earned his single/multi-engine land and sea,
            commercial, instrument, and rotorcraft ratings along with various
            endorsements. His natural energy and knack for engineering feed his
            love for the challenge to circumvent the norms and “build it
            better.” This drives his passion to create and build his own
            airplanes, which he uses for competitive racing, STOL, flying his
            family, business, and playing with his fellow “Flying Cowboys.” He
            holds several aviation records and enthusiastically shares his
            process and adventures via his YouTube channel.

            Born in Gresham, Oregon, in 1972, Mark started life as a
            high-energy, curious child. Mark has built multiple successful
            companies, starting the first at the age of 15 and employing
            hundreds by the age of 21. Mark is an identical twin and lives in

            <br /><br />

            Mark and his family currently own and operate Best Tugs employing
            hundreds as they manufacture the best general aviation tugs on the
            market. If you’re in need of an aircraft tug, Best Tugs is the best
            out there. Past achievements have included building several other
            successful businesses, both large and small. He was the host of his
            own motorsports show on ESPN, and is consistently rated as one of

            Jason Sneed was born in Pensacola, Florida. His love of flight began
            early, thanks to both of his grandfathers. One gave him his first
            taste in a v-tail Bonanza at the age of 18 months and as he grew
            older, he was able to work on his other grandfather’s full-sized MD
            F-4J Phantom II Blue Angel replica in his garage. By age 13, Jason
            had earned enough money cleaning yards to purchase a Commodore 64,
            which he used to practice proficiency in instrument flying. In 1999,
            he completed training in his Cessna 140 and has since acquired
            instrument and multi-engine commercial ratings. With 2 airplane
            builds under his belt, a Rans S7S, and a Carbon Cub, he is currently
            working on “Deception”, a 330 hp Carbon Cub. He is a member of the
            “Flying Cowboys” and has a profound passion for flying, which he
            shares with everyone he meets as well as on his YouTube channel,
            found under “Jason Sneed.”

            Kevin Quinn is a flying freak…seriously. It’s about all he thinks
            about, and how to do it SAFELY! Kevin is a former professional
            hockey player and played in the ECHL, WCHL, WHL with brief stints in
            the IHL and AHL. He retired in 1995 and started pursuing his
            aviation and ski life. Kevin allocates time between flying
            airplanes, running his heli-ski operation in Alaska (Points North 24
            years), and spending as much time in the ocean at his other home in
            Kauai, HI. Of course time with his family is the most important to
            him. Kevin has been flying since he was a kid with his father and
            relatives growing up in Alaska. Kevin has an FAA Commercial Flight
            Instructor (CFI) certificate with an instrument rating and currently
            has just under 9000 hours of total time, most in the off-airport
            environment. Additionally, he’s an EMT/ Wilderness medicine trainer,
            Avalanche Educator, and former President of U.S. Heli Ski
            Association (8 years) and is a Certified Heli-Ski Guide Trainer. He
            created the High Sierra Fly-in (11 years running now) and created
            STOL Drag, which is also the newest class of racing at Reno. He is a
            member of The Flying Cowboys and recently purchased a 1944 Stearman.
            To say he is passionate about aviation would be an understatement.
            <br /><br />

            Sharing his passions with others is something that he looks forward
            to daily. He will fly just about anything he can get his hands on:
            Airplane, Glider (sailplane) Paraglider, Powered Paragliger,
            Skydive, Speed Wing, you name it. He has been fortunate to fly a
            number of different aircraft including Helio Couriers, Super Cubs,
            Cessnas (152, 172, 170, 180, 182, 185, 206), Beaver, Maule,
            Highlander, Stretch SuperStol, and few Cirrus aircraft. His newest
            passion is Biplanes and the history that goes with them, recently
            being checked out in a Navy N3N biplane and then a Stearman. His
            passion really is landing bush planes above 9000' daily. He is an
            EAA Young Eagles Pilot with nearly 100 kids flown to dates, and that
            number changes almost weekly. Safety and training is his primary
            responsibility in life. As a father of two children (6&10) and
            married to his beautiful wife Jessica (together now over 20 years
            and she lets him fly with her full support), Kevin is set on safely
            accessing the backcountry and training others to do so as well.
            Making good pilots better is his mission.
            <br /><br />

            His Instagram is @STOLPilot and he also runs several Facebook groups
            including Big Tire Backcountry Flier Page, STOL Pilot, and Points
            North Heli pages.

            Steve really enjoys competing in STOL Drag and STOL events while
            also flying the extreme backcountry. Steve started flying in 2003 in
            his hometown of Nampa, Idaho and built his first Just Aircraft
            Highlander in 2004, becoming dealers for them in 2010. Steve is
            constantly thinking up new ways he can make these already amazing
            planes perform even better. After making a YouTube video of a dead
            stick take off on one of the steep hills in his area, flying two
            miles and 1500 feet down to a river bed with no engine running, and
            landing, he got a lot of folk's attention. He flew his 2014 Just
            Aircraft SuperSTOL to Valdez and finished third behind Frank Knapp
            and Josh Peppered. Steve also placed first at the STOL Competitions
            at Oshkosh in 2017 and 2018 and got a close second place at High
            Sierra in 2019. He won the High Sierra Fly-In STOL Drag in 2016 and
            had a very, very close second in 2017, as well as the second-best
            time next to DRACO in 2018. Needless to say, Steve is a tough
            competitor at STOL Drag! Steve also received the Charles Lindbergh
            Reserve Grand Champion Award at EAA AirVenture for Light Sport Plane
            in 2018 with Yee-Haw 6 and won it again in 2019 with Yee-Haw 7. Both
            planes have Yamaha engines with SkyTrax PSRU. Steve can’t say enough
            of the Edge Performance's EPeX Yamaha 300 HP engine in Yee-Haw 7,
            it’s truly a beast. Steve is always open to chatting about
            Highlanders, and if you ever have questions he’s happy to chat.

            Trent Palmer started his aviation career flying drones. When the FAA
            came out with new regulations in 2014, the change inspired Palmer to
            get his pilots license in order to comply with the new rules.
            Terrified of flying and heights, the opportunity was not something
            that excited Trent. However, by the time his training complete, he
            was already on the hunt for an airplane he could afford…and thus was
            born the Freedom Fox.Trent has enjoyed being involved in both STOL
            demonstrations at Oshkosh, as well as STOL Drag at Reno and High
            Sierra Fly-In, where he took 2nd place only to Draco.

            Creighton King loves flying and building airplanes. Born into an
            aviation lineage from the 1920’s, Creighton soloed on his 16th
            birthday and has been flying ever since. He has a fantastic bride
            Tonya, 2 teenage daughters, 2 dogs, and 3 airplanes. Creighton owns
            a 56 piper Tripacer he learned to fly in, a Cassutt Racer that he
            has improved through the years to gain nearly 50 mph in Reno, and an
            experimental Cub. His buddies lovingly called the cub Rusty, and it
            stuck. His Dad built it and Creighton helped finish it and that cub
            has continued to fly for 27 years until bending in a big cross wind
            crash on a beach. Creighton is currently rebuilding “Rusty” and
            making it even better. Rusty was flying before the other Cowboys and
            may have a bit of rust, but after the rebuild it should fly very
            well. Creighton is pretty good at TIG Welding as well as building
            light weight carbon parts. He likes to cover with Stits fabric and
            paint with a Harbor Freight paint gun. He is also the inventor of
            www.GripLockTies.com; Releasable Rubber-Lined Zip Ties. He spends
            his days working to build the company and help eliminate crappy zip
            ties from the planet.

          <p class="description">
            Hal lives in the desert of Elko, NV. In April of 2020 after working
            45 years on large mining and construction equipment, Hal finally
            decided to retire and now devotes his time solely to aviation and
            his love for Rotax engines. Hal’s love for aviation spans decades.
            In 1995, he and his brother-in-law built an ultralight, and was the
            first time Hal discovered experimental aircraft. In 1999, Hal bought
            his first Rans S-7, which he enjoyed tinkering with to pull more and
            more power out of. In 2010 he started working with Rotax engines,
            which he also modified and altered to produce even more power. With
            his latest project, Lawn Mower 3, Hal enjoys competing in STOL
            competitions, and having that extra power on such a light aircraft
            makes a huge difference. Flying and working on little airplanes is
            all Hal wants to do with his retirement time, and he’s having a
            blast. He has over 4000 hours in Ran S-7 airplanes alone, and hopes
            to get many more.

            would be an understatement. Formerly a TACP/Forward Air Controller
            with the USAF after serving his country during Operation Iraqi
            Freedom Scott pursued the sport of skydiving with an unrelenting
            focus. Over 15 years and 11,000 skydives Scott has traveled the
            world competing, teaching, and creating a unique sub-discipline
            within the Indoor and outdoor skydiving scenes. He has multiple
            world records and championship titles and is a highly sought after
            coach for the emerging Indoor Skydiving discipline. After reaching
            the pinnacle of skydiving Scott changed his focus from flying his
            body to flying airplanes. Now a Commercial Pilot with an instrument
            rating when not refining his skills flying his Modified Kitfox IV
